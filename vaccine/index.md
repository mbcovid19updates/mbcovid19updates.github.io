## Urban Indigenous Clinics

These clinics are for anyone, but do prioritize people who self-identity as First Nations (status or non-status), Metis or Inuit or people who share a household with someone who identifies as Indigenous.  They are also available for those who may face barriers in booking a vaccination appointiment such as those who are houseless.  Appointments at these clinics may be booked but walk-in appointments are also available daily.  An Elder or traditional Knowledge Keeper will be at sites regularly, and traditional ceremony, smudging and traditional medicines may also be offered.
