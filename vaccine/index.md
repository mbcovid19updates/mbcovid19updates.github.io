### Super Sites

All supersites, except RBC Convention Centre, are now offering walk-in appointments. The number of walk-ins may vary by day and by site, but are approximately 10% of all doses available. It is important to note that a limited number of walk-ins available on a daily basis. Sites will continue to prioritize first-dose immunizations for walk-ins when possible. Only some sites have walk-in days/times listed... we'll update the list as more data becomes available.
