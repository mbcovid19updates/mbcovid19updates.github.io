## Current Restrictions

_Last updated: January 3, 2022_

The following restrictions are in effect as of Saturday, January 1, 2022, at 12:01 am:


### Confirmed Cases and Close Contacts

- Individuals identified as having COVID-19 must immediately enter mandatory isolation until public health officials advise they can end isolation.
- Close contacts of a person or persons with COVID-19, unless otherwise exempt, must immediately go into mandatory self-isolation (quarantine) for 10 days, followed by 4 days of self-monitoring for symptoms, from the last date of exposure. They should call Health Links--Info Santé (204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257) if they develop symptoms.
- Household members of close contacts do not need to self-isolate (quarantine) as long as they and the close contact in the household remain without symptoms. If the close contact develops symptoms, all household members, unless otherwise exempt, should self-isolate (quarantine) until the symptomatic individual receives their COVID-19 test result.
- Close contacts and household members of close contacts may be exempt from self-isolation (quarantine) if they have no symptoms AND are fully immunized at the time of the exposure or have had a COVID-19 infection within the past 6 months. Public health officials will let close contacts know if they meet criteria for exemption from self-isolation (quarantine). All individuals exempt from self-isolation (quarantine) requirements, should continue to self-monitor for symptoms, and isolate immediately if any develop and go for testing.

_UPDATE: January 3, 2022_

Self-isolation order has changed and sets out updated isolation requirements for asymptomatic positive cases and symptomatic individuals depending on vaccination status. For some, isolation has changed from 10 to 5 days.

The changes include:

- Requiring all people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to isolate including those who completed a rapid antigen test;
- Changing isolation requirements to 5 days from 10 days since the date of the test for fully-vaccinated people who are not showing symptoms;
- Changing isolation requirements to 5 days from 10 days since the date symptoms started appearing or the date of the test, whichever is later, for fully-vaccinated people as long as their symptoms are improving and they do not have a fever;
- Requiring individuals who have only isolated for 5 days due to the changes above to wear medical-grade mask while in a public setting for the five days immediately following their self-isolation; and
- Requiring isolation for people who have tested positive who are not fully vaccinated for 10 days after the date of their test as long as their symptoms are improving and they do not have a fever.

The operator of an indoor public place must ensure that every person who is not wearing a mask while in the indoor public place is given a reminder to do so as soon as possible following entry.

Masks are not required if people are seated at least two metres from others, or if there is a non-permeable physical barrier, such as a plexiglass barrier. However, people need to wear a mask at all times while moving to or from their seated position within the indoor public place.

In addition, employees, contractors or operators of an indoor public place do not need to wear a mask while they are in an area where members of the public do not normally have access, or if they are behind a non-permeable physical barrier, including a plexiglass barrier.

People can temporarily remove their mask while in an indoor public place:

- to receive a service that requires the removal of their mask,
- to consume food or drink;
- to deal with an emergency or medical purpose, or
- to establish their identity.

People who do not have to wear masks include:

- a child who is under five years of age;
- a person with a medical condition that is unrelated to COVID-19, including breathing or cognitive difficulties or a disability, which prevents them from safely wearing a mask;
- a person who is swimming or engaged in other athletic activities; and
- a person who is unable to put on or remove a mask without the assistance of another person.

#### What is considered an indoor public space?

An indoor public space includes:

- any part of a retail store where the public has access;
- any part of the common areas of a residential building;
- a health care facility;
- an educational institution or facility;

## Vaccine Eligibility

_Last updated: November 22, 2021_

This is a summary of current vaccine eligibility. We do our best to keep it up to date, but you can also view the [Official Vaccine Eligibility](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/eligibility-criteria.html) information page on the Manitoba website.

### First Doses

- **Anyone aged 5 and up** is eligible to receive their first dose of a COVID vaccine.
   - Young people aged 5-11 must receive a special pediatric (smaller) dose of _Pfizer_ for both doses, as this is currently the only vaccine approved for use in this age group.

### Second Doses

- **Anyone** who has had their first dose of a COVID vaccine is eligible to receive their second dose after a minimum of 28 days since first dose. Following guidance from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, Manitoba is now **recommending individuals receive their second dose of vaccine 56 days (eight weeks) after their first dose**. Previously, the recommendation was 28 days (four weeks). The longer time period between doses has been shown to provide a stronger immune response over time. However, the minimum time frame between first and second doses will remain at 28 days so individuals will be able to choose the timing of vaccine schedule based on their own circumstances.
   - People age 18+ may choose either mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) as their second dose, regardless of which vaccine they received for first dose.
   - Young people under the age of 18 must receive _Pfizer_ for both doses, as this is currently the only vaccine approved for use in this age group.
   - If AstraZeneca was your first dose, an 8-12 week interval is recommended, but can be as low as 28 days.

### Third/Booster Dose

- **Anyone aged 18 and older** and a minimum of **6 months** after their second dose, except in very limited circumstances.
    - You will need a prescription from a doctor if you are requesting your third dose earlier than six months because you are moderately to severely immunocompromised or because you require it for travel purposes. Individuals who are unsure of the date of their last immunization can check their record here.

### Medical Exemptions

For the vast majority of people, the COVID-19 vaccine is a safe and effective way to protect themselves and others against the virus.

However, there is a very small number of people who can’t or shouldn’t be immunized. If you feel that you may qualify for a medical exemption based on the criteria listed below, the first step is to schedule an appointment with your own health care provider and/or your specialist. 

They will review the exemption criteria with you to determine if you may qualify. Only a specialist physician can request a medical exemption from the province, based on your medical history. Individuals cannot submit their own requests for exemption.Once it is submitted, information about the exemption will be entered into the provincial immunization database, including whether the exemption is permanent or temporary.   

Exempt people will be able to request their digital or physical Manitoba immunization card approximately seven to 14 business days after their exemption is submitted. The card and the display shown after scanning the QR code will be identical to those currently used by fully immunized people. This will help protect the private health information of exempt individuals, while also keeping a simple, consistent process for venues and events that must validate immunization status. 

#### Criteria
- Had a severe reaction after the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (e.g. myocarditis, Guillain-Barré syndrome).
- Are receiving treatment that affects their ability to mount an immune response, meaning vaccination must be timed carefully with their treatment schedule (e.g. receiving immunocompromising treatment after a transplant, certain types of cancer treatments).
- Had a severe allergy or anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or its components that cannot be managed by the Health Sciences Centre Allergy Clinic.

### How to Book an Appointment

Appointments for first or second doses of vaccines can be booked at any super-site, pop-up clinic, or a doctor's office or pharmacy that is accepting appointments. Super-sites are by far the most efficient and easiest way to book an appointment.

- To book a vaccine appointment at a super-site or pop-up clinic by phone, call [1-844-626-8222](tel:18446268222) (1-844-MAN-VACC).
- To book a vaccine appointment at a super-site or pop-up clinic online, [visit the booking website here](https://patient.petalmd.com/login?groupId=6032).
   - You'll need to create an account with your email address and your 9-digit personal health identification number (PHIN) on your Manitoba Health Card.
   - You can link more than one person to the same account, so that you can also book for family members and loved ones.
   - If you don't have an email address or health card number, you'll need to call by phone instead: [1-844-626-8222](tel:18446268222) (1-844-MAN-VACC).
   - Daily hours of operation are from 6:00am to 8:00pm.

### AstraZeneca Information

_Last updated: July 27, 2021_

All people with AstraZeneca as first dose are now recommended to receive Pfizer or Moderna as their second dose. This has been proven safe and even offers a higher level of protection compared to receiving a second dose of AstraZeneca. It's recommended that you wait a minimum of 8 weeks before receiving your second dose of any of the vaccines, but you may receive one as early as 28 days from first dose.

If you strongly wish to receive a second dose of AstraZeneca, there are a total of 15 medical clinics and pharmacies that are acting as regional hubs to offer second-dose AstraZeneca vaccinations. You can use the [online vaccine finder](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/finder.html) to find a location with available doses.

#### Locations with AstraZeneca

The following medical clinics and pharmacies in the province have received AstraZeneca vaccine to provide second doses to individuals who cannot or will not receive a different type of vaccine. Please check the [online vaccine finder](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/finder.html) to confirm they have stock and are able to accept appointments.

## Variants of Concern

_Last updated: December 9, 2021_

All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, some changes may affect the virus’s properties, such as how easily it spreads, the associated disease severity, or the performance of vaccines, therapeutic medicines, diagnostic tools, or other public health and social measures.

For more information about Variants of Concern, visit the [WHO website](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).

In Manitoba, we currently track the following Variants of Concern:

WHO label | Lineage | Origin | Earliest Sample Date | Designation Date
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Alpha** | B.1.1.7 | United Kingdom | September, 2020 | December 18, 2020
**Beta** | B.1.351<br />B.1.351.2<br />B.1.351.3 | South Africa | May, 2020 | December 18, 2020
**Gamma** | P.1<br />P.1.1<br />P.1.2 | Brazil | November, 2020 | January 11, 2021
**Delta** | B.1.617.2<br />B.1.617.2.1<br />B.1.617.2.2 | India | October, 2020 | May 11, 2021
**Omicron** | B.1.1.529 | Multiple Countries | November, 2021 | November 26, 2021

There are also several other **variants of <u>interest</u>** that are being monitored right now, and may eventually become **variants of <u>concern</u>**.

Currently, the **Delta** (B.1.617.2 / India) variant is the dominant strain, suspected to account for roughly 98% of all new COVID cases in Manitoba (_as of November, 2021_). Manitoba does not currently have the capacity to sequence the exact strain of every last COVID case, so in many cases, they are labeled as "unspecified", but assumed to be the **Delta** variant.

The **Omicron** (B.1.1.52) variant has been discovered in Manitoba on December 7, 2021. We're still waiting on research, but so far it is believed that this variant is much more contagious, and more likely to evade 1-2 doses of current vaccines (but those with 3rd dose have significantly better protection). The potential good news is that this variant appears to have much milder symptoms.


### Will the Vaccine protect against Variants?

All approved vaccines in Canada are proven to be effective against the variants of concern, but studies suggest that 1 dose may not offer robust enough protection against the new **Delta** variant. This is why it's very important to receive your second dose of vaccine as soon as possible.

## Fines

_Last updated: September 10, 2021_

Below is a summary of Fine amounts for violating public health orders in Manitoba:


- **$298** for not wearing a mask in indoor public places. _Increases to $486 for repeat offenders._
- **$1,296** to individuals for failing to comply with public health orders such as illegal gatherings, failing to isolate, etc. _Increases to $2,542 for repeat offenders._
- **$5,000** to corporations for failing to comply with public health orders.

Unpaid fines for tickets for Public Health Act offences proceed through the provincial offences court. If the ticket is not responded to during the response period indicated on the ticket, the individual would be default convicted and a $100 default conviction penalty would be applied. In such cases, the individual would also be prohibited from renewing a driver’s license or vehicle registration until the amount is paid. Unpaid amounts are also sent to a collections agency for further collection action.

## Daily Dashboards

_Last updated: January 7, 2022_

Every day, we comb through all official COVID data and present it as a single unified dashboard, offering an easy-to-read and intuitive experience for understanding the current situation in Manitoba. All of the data comes from official sources, while some data comes from our own calculations. Here's an overview of every part of the daily dashboards and where/how we make calculations.

### Data Sources

- [Official Manitoba Case Data](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/updates/cases.html)
- [Official Manitoba Vaccine Data](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/reports.html)
- [Official Manitoba News Bulletins](https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html)
- [Provincial Case Reporting (ici.radio-canada.ca)](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2020/09/covid-19-pandemie-cas-deces-propagation-vague-maladie-coronavirus/index-en.html)
- [Provincial Vaccination Rate Reporting (ctvnews.ca)](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-vaccination-tracker-how-many-people-in-canada-have-received-shots-1.5247509)

### Descriptions & Calculations

#### (1) Today
The total listed here is based on what the province reported today, usually from yesterday's tests. On Mondays (or other days after a holiday and/or long weekend), when more than 1 day is presented, we'll include an average. For example, on Mondays, we'll include an average of all 3 days (Saturday, Sunday and Monday). If there were 120 cases total, we will display the daily average as 40. The 7-day average in smaller text below is based on the last 7 days of new case totals.

_UPDATE: January 7, 2022_
Due to massive demand and backlogs in testing, as well as changes to testing protocols, Public Health officials advise that potentially as much as 90% of cases are not officially accounted for.

#### (2) 10 Days
The total listed here is based on the **last 10 days of new cases**. This is because the Manitoba government's official active case total is usually very backlogged, as they appear to not be able to keep up with following up with people and confirming they have recovered. The vast majority of people with COVID-19 recover and are no longer infectious after 10 days, so we instead use an estimated total that is based on that. Whether or not the real number is a touch higher or lower, this offers the most consistent gauge on current active cases.

_UPDATE: January 7, 2022_
Due to massive demand and backlogs in testing, as well as changes to testing protocols, Public Health officials advise that potentially as much as 90% of cases are not officially accounted for.

#### (3) Hosp
The total listed here is the total number of hospitalized patients that are in the hospital with and/or due to COVID. The province breaks down cases as "active" (infectious) and "non-active" (past the infectious period), but we don't see why it's necessary to distinguish this difference, so we don't include it. This total includes the total number of people in the ICU as well. 

_UPDATE: January 7, 2022_
It's been clarified that this does include people that have gone into hospitals for different reasons and have also tested positive for COVID. I suspect this was less of an issue (smaller percentage) in the past, but with Omicron being so widespread and infectious, it's definitely skewing the numbers. The province of Quebec mentioned as much as 40% of their hospitalization cases fall into this category (not there because of COVID). Manitoba plans to address this in the near future (and we'll adjust our numbers/stats accordingly).

#### (4) ICU
The total listed here is the total number of hospitalized patients requiring intensive care that are in the hospital with and/or due to COVID. The province breaks down cases as "active" (infectious) and "non-active" (past the infectious period), but we don't see why it's necessary to distinguish this difference, so we don't include it.

#### (5) Deaths
The large number here is the number of new deaths reported today. The province delays this data in order to verify and prevent incorrect reporting, so please note that most deaths reported today likely happened several days or more ago. The smaller total is the total number of deaths due to COVID since the beginning of the pandemic.

#### (6) Vaccine Coverage
We base all vaccination calculations on the entire population (age 0+). Sometimes you may see these numbers reported elsewhere as age 12+ or age 18+, and that may be why our numbers may look a little different.

- **Fully vaxxed** refers to the total number of Manitobans that have received at least 2 vaccinations.
- **At least 1 dose** refers to the total number of Manitobans that have received at least 1 vaccination.
- **Partial vax** refers to the total number of Manitobans that have received only 1 dose of the vaccine (different than _at least 1 dose_).
- **Unvaxxed** refers to the total number of eligible (age 5+) Manitobans that have not yet received any vaccination.
- **Ineligible** refers to the total number of Manitobans not currently eligible to receive any COVID vaccine (under age 5).

All of our calculations such as totals, age group and health region are based upon population totals from the [Manitoba Population Report - June 1, 2020](https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/population/) (latest available). The government likely has access to more current population data, so totals might differ ever so slightly.

#### (7) Status Breakdown / Risk to Not Fully Vaccinated
The Vaccine Protection area provides a breakdown of cases and hospitalizations in order to show vaccine effectiveness. Please note that these stats are based on the last 6 weeks of case data.

#### (8) Provincial Stats
This section displays active cases, hospitalization and vaccine uptake data about the 6 provinces (BC, AB, SK, MB, ON, QC). All of the data is from **yesterday**, as more Western provinces take longer to report their totals due to time zone differences. For the most accurate comparison, active cases are based on the last 10 days of new case reporting. Vaccine uptake numbers are based on the total number of people with at least 2 doses of vaccine.

#### (9) Cases by Age
This section includes a per capita breakdown of how many cases per 100K for each age group from the last 7 days of reported cases. This provides a glimpse at how COVID is spreading throughout the different population age groups.

## About Us

_Last updated: June 29, 2021_

The _Manitoba COVID-19 Updates_ account/site is completely volunteer run. We receive no funding, we make no money. We're fueled by your positive feedback and when you share our social media accounts with others. It is **not** affiliated with the Manitoba government in any way. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I found myself wanting to help serve Manitoba in a meaningful way. Not going to give any excuses, but that didn't quite happen during the first year. Then in January, 2021 (better late than never!), I saw an opportunity. I am a designer and project manager by trade, and throughout the second wave I became very frustrated with how difficult it was to access, read, and understand the updates and news about COVID in Manitoba. On January 5, 2021, we published our first daily update, and over the past several months have grown significantly in social media followers (THANK YOU!).

### Private/Direct Messages

I do my best to answer as many people as possible, but I am one person with a regular full time job and family and don't have the time and all the answers to get to everyone. I apologize if I haven't replied to your private messages in the past (or future). As the following grows bigger and bigger, it's even harder to keep up. I built this website resource in hopes that it will help answer many questions people ask me privately so they can get answers faster.
