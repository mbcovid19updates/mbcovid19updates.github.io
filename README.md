## Vaccine Eligibility

_Last updated: June 22, 2021_

This is a summary of current vaccine eligibility. We do our best to keep it up to date, but you can also view the [Official Vaccine Eligibility](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/eligibility-criteria.html) information page on the Manitoba website.

### First Doses

- **Anyone age 12 and up** is eligible to receive their first dose of a COVID vaccine.
   - Young people aged 12 to 17 must receive _Pfizer_ for both doses, as this is currently the only vaccine approved for use in this age group.

### Second Doses

Due to current supply constraints, Manitoba is not able to provide the second dose at the recommended intervals. In an effort to get more people with some amount of vaccine protection, second doses were delayed for most people. Please note that there is no danger in receiving your second dose later. In fact, studies have shown that going longer in between doses offers better efficacy. Manitoba currently has a multi-tiered approach to prioritizing second doses.

You are eligible to receive your second dose if <u>any</u> of the following apply:

- You have priority health conditions ([see list here](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/eligibility-criteria.html#criteria)).
- You are Indigenous
- You received your first dose of vaccine **on or before May 29, 2021**.

**AND**

- You received your first dose a minimum of 28 days ago.
   - AstraZeneca is a minimum of 28 days ago, but 8 weeks ago is recommended.

#### Wasn't Pfizer 21 days?

Yes, it used to be 21 days for Pfizer, but with the current backlog of second doses and an effort to simplify / unify the waiting period, Manitoba now recommends 28 days for both Pfizer and Moderna. For what it's worth, with vaccines, a longer interval typically results in better or slightly better efficacy (rather than hurting it).

<a name="pfizer"></a>
### Where can I find Pfizer?

_Last updated: June 23, 2021_

To be clear, Pfizer is arriving all the time, but it's for already booked appointments. There will be a slowdown beginning next week that will potentially result in a shortage for existing booked appointments (though this may possibly be offset by people cancelling and rebooking for earlier Moderna appointments). That slowdown will pick up again towards the end of July. My best guess is that with the exception of catching oddball cancellations, Pfizer appointments won't become available for another 3 weeks or so (around July 15+), and be scheduled for late July, early August.

**EXTRA INFO/CONTEXT**

For context, please keep in mind that appointments (almost all Pfizer) were booking out 5 weeks recently. The majority of these are dependent on the ongoing Pfizer supply. This means that while we have been receiving roughly 80-90K doses of Pfizer each week, they are designated for upcoming appointments that have already been booked. Now, consider that around 350K doses of Moderna have arrived recently within a 2-week span. This is massive and almost considered an unexpected bonus. Because of this, Manitoba has been able to very quickly open up more and more appointments daily, but the vast majority of them are for Moderna.

With a growing number of people becoming eligible to book appointments, and a skewed ratio of Moderna vs Pfizer availability, it becomes more of a perception issue. Manitoba essentially has 2 options here: 1) Sit on the Moderna and continue to very slowly open up second dose eligibility as Pfizer comes in, or 2) Quickly open up eligibility to everyone, but most people will have to switch to Moderna or wait a long time for Pfizer appointments. But consider this... if you're wanting Pfizer, you would have been waiting even longer for your turn if the Moderna never arrived and if these Moderna appointments weren't made available.

And finally, since the majority of people have received Pfizer for their first dose, it will be a bit of an education process and people coming to terms with switching, which will result in Pfizer doses being harder to find for new appointments over the next few weeks. But it's important to note, there will eventually be more Pfizer appointments available, and you will not be forced to switch to Moderna if you don't wish to.

It's worth noting that Moderna and Pfizer are both mRNA vaccines that offer almost the same level of protection and are considered interchangeable. Moderna appointments are booking as early as a few days from now too.

### How to Book an Appointment

Appointments for first or second doses of vaccines can be booked at any super-site, pop-up clinic, or a doctor's office or pharmacy that is accepting appointments. Super-sites are by far the most efficient and easiest way to book an appointment.

- To book a vaccine appointment at a super-site or pop-up clinic by phone, call 1-844-MAN-VACC (1-844-626-8222).
- To book a vaccine appointment at a super-site or pop-up clinic online, [visit the booking website here](https://patient.petalmd.com/login?groupId=6032).
   - You'll need to create an account with your email address and your 9-digit personal health identification number (PHIN) on your Manitoba Health Card.
   - You can link more than one person to the same account, so that you can also book for family members and loved ones.
   - If you don't have an email address or health card number, you'll need to call by phone instead: 1-844-626-8222 (1-844-MAN-VACC)
   - Daily hours of operation are from 6:00am to 8:00pm.
- To book a vaccine appointment at a doctor's office or pharmacy, you'll need to contact them directly. To find available locations, [visit the Vaccine Finder tool](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/finder.html).
- If you are a senior or have mobility issues and need help getting to your appointment at a clinic or pharmacy, call 211 for available transportation options in your area.

### Mixing Vaccines

_Last updated: June 18, 2021_

Studies have shown that it is safe to mix vaccines. Due to limited supply of AstraZeneca, people with their first dose of AstraZeneca are recommended to receive their second dose as Pfizer or Moderna. If you received Pfizer as your first dose, you may also receive Moderna as your second dose and vice versa. Moderna and Pfizer are both mRNA vaccines that offer almost the same level of protection and are considered interchangeable. Moderna appointments are booking as early as a few days from now too.

Here are some resources to learn more about this:

- [Summary of National Advisory Committee on Immunization statement of June 17, 2021](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccines/summary-statement-june-17-2021.html) (Government of Canada, June 17, 2021)

<a name="astrazeneca"></a>
### AstraZeneca Information

_Last updated: June 18, 2021_

If your first dose of vaccine was AstraZeneca, please note that limited supplies exist. All people with AstraZeneca as first dose are now recommended to receive Pfizer or Moderna as their second dose. This has been proven safe and even offers a higher level of protection compared to receiving a second dose of AstraZeneca. It's recommended that you wait a minimum of 8 weeks before receiving your second dose of any of the vaccines, but you may receive one as early as 28 days from first dose.

If you strongly wish to receive a second dose of AstraZeneca, the province announced (June 18, 2021) that a total of 15 medical clinics and pharmacies will soon act as regional hubs to offer second-dose AstraZeneca vaccinations. Beginning next week, individuals will be able to use the [online vaccine finder](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/finder.html) to find a location with available doses.

#### Locations to receive AstraZeneca soon

The following medical clinics and pharmacies in the province will receive AstraZeneca vaccine to provide second doses to individuals who cannot or will not receive a different type of vaccine. Sites will update their information on the [online vaccine finder](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/finder.html) when they are ready to begin making appointments. **PLEASE CHECK THE VACCINE FINDER TOOL TO CONFIRM DOSES ARE AVAILABLE**

### Consent Forms

You will need to fill out and print a consent form for first and second dose appointments. Filling out the form in advance will also make it faster for you to get your vaccine. [Click here to download, fill out and print the consent forms](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/resources.html#forms).

If you cannot print out a consent form, there will be some available at the vaccination site/clinic.

<a href="https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/resources.html#form" class="button">Download and Print Consent Form</a>

### Vaccination Status

If you've been vaccinated, you can check the status of your vaccination online. It usually shows up within a day or two, but could take several days. Once you've received both doses of vaccine, be sure to [apply for the Immunization Card](#vaccine-cards).

<a href="https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/test-results/" class="button">COVID Vaccination Status</a>

### Received your vaccine outside of Manitoba?

Individuals who received their COVID-19 vaccine outside of the province should have their vaccination information added into Manitoba's immunization system. In order to do this, you will need proof of immunization from the jurisdiction where you received your vaccine.

If the vaccine you received is eligible for use in Canada, you can then bring this proof of immunization to a public health office. The office will enter this information to ensure that your primary care physician and our public health teams can have access to your immunization records.

You can contact or visit a public health office, or email [covidimmunizationrecordsinformation@gov.mb.ca](mailto:covidimmunizationrecordsinformation@gov.mb.ca) to update that information. This email address can also be used to request other updates or corrections to a COVID-19 immunization.

### Vaccine Cards

_Last updated: June 13, 2021_

Fully vaccinated Manitobans are now able to receive Immunization cards. The digital and physical cards contain no personal health information or data. Rather, the cards only show the person’s first and last names and a QR code. When scanned, the QR code will show the person is fully vaccinated.

#### Current Benefits

Current benefits for fully immunized Manitobans:

- Travel within Canada without having to self-isolate upon return.
- Exempt from self-isolation if identified as a COVID close contact.
- Expanded visitation to Manitoba health-care facilities, including hospitals & personal care homes if both the patient/resident and visitor are fully vaccinated. This benefit is expected to be extended to health-care facility visitation in the coming week.

Additional benefits are expected to be added in the coming weeks. We'll update this as information comes out.

#### Eligibility

To be eligible to receive an immunization card, Manitobans must:

- have a Manitoba health card.
- have received two doses of a vaccine.
- wait 14 days after getting the second dose of vaccine.

**NOTE:** At this time, an immunization card is only available for people with a Manitoba health card. To find out if you are eligible for a Manitoba health card, go to the [Manitoba Health and Seniors Care website](https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/index.html#Q1). Once you receive your Manitoba health card, you can request your immunization card online. If you are not eligible for a Manitoba health card, you may contact your [local public health office](https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/offices.html) and they can provide you with a copy of your vaccination record.

#### Questions?

The Manitoba government has assembled a [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/immunization-record.html) on the COVID-19 Vaccine website as well as a [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section](https://immunizationcard.manitoba.ca/#/faq?lang=en) on the Immunization Card website.

## COVID Symptoms & Testing

_Last updated: June 10, 2021_

### Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 may include any of the following:

- Fever/Chills
- Cough
- Sore throat/hoarse voice
- Difficulty breathing
- Loss of taste or smell
- Vomiting, diarrhea for more than 24 hours
- Runny nose
- Muscle aches
- Fatigue
- Pink eye (conjunctivitis)
- Headache
- Skin rash of unknown cause
- Poor feeding in an infant
- Nausea or loss of appetite

While many people will develop only mild symptoms, some groups appear to be more vulnerable to COVID-19. Those at higher risk typically develop more serious, even fatal, symptoms such as pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and kidney failure.

### High risk groups for COVID-19

High risk groups for COVID-19 include people:

- 60 years of age and older
- Living with chronic health conditions (e.g. diabetes, heart, renal or chronic lung conditions)
- With weakened immune systems (e.g. cancer)

**Symptoms of COVID-19 or other coronaviruses may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the virus.**

### When should I get Tested?
Testing should be done **as soon as possible once symptoms appear**. You should still be tested even if your symptoms are very mild or if they start to improve after 24 hours. It is important to get tested as soon as symptoms appear, as tracing and isolating contacts in a timely manner is important to limiting the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

If you have **one symptom listed in column A**, OR **two or more symptoms listed in column B**, you should immediately isolate yourself and [use the online screening tool](https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/screening-tool/) or call **Health Links - Info Santé** (204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257) for further instructions, including where to go for testing and/or assessment.

Symptoms **A** | Symptoms **B**
--- | ---
Fever/Chills | Runny nose
Cough | Muscle aches
Sore throat/hoarse voice | Fatigue
Shortness of breath/difficulty breathing | Pink eye (conjunctivitis)
Loss of taste or smell | Headache
Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 24 hours | Skin rash of unknown cause
&nbsp; | Poor feeding if an infant
&nbsp; | Nausea or loss of appetite

If you choose to not get tested, you will need to isolate for at least 10 days, and until you no longer have fever for 24 hours and your other symptoms have resolved. If you have travelled or been exposed to a case, you should continue to self-isolate (quarantine) for the remainder of the 14-day period.

## Variants of Concern

_Last updated: June 23, 2021_

All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, some changes may affect the virus’s properties, such as how easily it spreads, the associated disease severity, or the performance of vaccines, therapeutic medicines, diagnostic tools, or other public health and social measures.

For more information about Variants of Concern, visit the [WHO website](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).

In Manitoba, we currently track the following Variants of Concern:

WHO label | Lineage | Origin | Earliest Sample Date | Designation Date
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Alpha** | B.1.1.7 | United Kingdom | September, 2020 | December 18, 2020
**Beta** | B.1.351 | South Africa | May, 2020 | December 18, 2020
**Gamma** | P.1 | Brazil | November, 2020 | January 11, 2021
**Delta** | B.1.617.2 | India | October, 2020 | May 11, 2021

There are also several other **variants of <u>interest</u>** that are being monitored right now, and may eventually become **variants of <u>concern</u>**.

Currently, the **Alpha** (B.1.1.7 / UK) variant is the dominant strain, suspected to account for roughly 60% of all new COVID cases in Manitoba (_as of June 10, 2021_). Manitoba does not currently have the capacity to sequence the exact strain of every last COVID case, so in many cases (over half), they are labeled as "unspecified", but assumed to be the **Alpha** (B.1.1.7 / UK) variant. Based on the evidence so far, researchers believe the **Alpha** variant is much more contagious and more deadlier than other variants, resulting in more younger people ending up in the hospital and an increase in ICU hospitalizations.

Recently, the **Delta** (B.1.617.2 / India) variant has been discovered in Manitoba, and is reported to be much more contagious than the **Alpha** variant, and more likely to evade current vaccines. This variant is expected to eventually become the new dominant strain in time.

### Will the Vaccine protect against Variants?

All approved vaccines in Canada are proven to be effective against the variants of concern, but studies suggest that 1 dose may not offer robust enough protection against the new **Delta** variant. This is why many provinces, including Manitoba, have quickly switched back to prioritizing giving out second doses of the vaccine.

### Will Public Health notify me if I have a Variant of Concern?

Since the **Alpha** (B.1.1.7 / UK) variant is currently the dominant strain, it's now assumed that all cases are likely the **Alpha** variant unless otherwise proven. Because of this, Manitoba Public Health will no longer notify you if your positive COVID test ends up being the **Alpha** variant (you will still be notified if you test positive of COVID). If your positive COVID test ends up being a different variant of concern (after sequencing, which could be a couple of days later), public health will likely notify you.

## Fines

_Last updated: June 11, 2021_

Below is a summary of Fine amounts for violating public health orders in Manitoba:

- **$298** for not wearing a mask in indoor public places. _Increases to $486 for repeat offenders._
- **$1,296** to individuals for failing to comply with public health orders such as illegal gatherings, failing to isolate, etc. _Increases to $2,542 for repeat offenders._
- **$5,000** to corporations for failing to comply with public health orders.

Unpaid fines for tickets for Public Health Act offences proceed through the provincial offences court. If the ticket is not responded to during the response period indicated on the ticket, the individual would be default convicted and a $100 default conviction penalty would be applied. In such cases, the individual would also be prohibited from renewing a driver’s license or vehicle registration until the amount is paid. Unpaid amounts are also sent to a collections agency for further collection action.

## Daily Dashboards

_Last updated: June 20, 2021_

Every day, we comb through all official COVID data and present it as a single unified dashboard, offering an easy-to-read and intuitive experience for understanding the current situation in Manitoba. All of the data comes from official sources, while some data comes from our own calculations. Here's an overview of every part of the daily dashboards and where/how we make calculations.

### Data Sources

- [Official Manitoba Case Data](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/updates/cases.html)
- [Official Manitoba Vaccine Data](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/reports.html)
- [Official Manitoba News Bulletins](https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html)
- [Provincial Case Reporting (ici.radio-canada.ca)](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2020/09/covid-19-pandemie-cas-deces-propagation-vague-maladie-coronavirus/index-en.html)

### Active Cases

The Manitoba government's official active case total is usually very backlogged, as they appear to not be able to keep up with following up with people and confirming they have recovered. The vast majority of people with COVID-19 recover / are no longer infectious after 10 days, so we instead use an estimated total that is based off of the **last 10
days of new cases**. Whether or not the real number is a touch higher or lower, this offers the most consistent gauge on current active cases.

The **Active Cases Provincially** section displays data from **yesterday**, as more Western provinces take longer to report their totals due to time zone differences.

### Hospitalization

The Manitoba government makes a distinction between whether or not the current hospitalization of a patient is infectious or not, and puts a heavy emphasis on the infectious patient totals (which make numbers appear to be lower). We do not do this because regardless of whether a COVID patient is infectious or not, they are still in the hospital due to COVID, and still occupying space and requiring care.

### Vaccinations

Our vaccination totals and percentages for first doses and second doses will usually be a little bit higher than the official reported totals. The Manitoba government reports the overall total of vaccinations, but there is always a rolling delay of around 5,000 - 10,000 vaccinations (fluctuates) that are yet to be categorized as first or second doses. We look at the previous 7 days of vaccination history and formulate an estimate as to how many of those are likely to be first or second doses. For example, the government may report 800,000 total vaccinations, but just 700,000 first doses and 90,000 second doses (totaling 790,000). Our formula (always changing) may be 10% first doses and 90% second doses. If you take those remaining 10,000 uncategorized vaccinations and run the formula on it, that would be 701,000 first doses and 99,000 second doses (700,000 + 1,000 = 701,000 and then 90,000 + 9,000 = 99,000 for a total of 800,000).

We also record daily progress of vaccinations per age group and health region and calculate uptake percentages, but this is based upon the [Manitoba Population Report - June 1, 2020](https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/population/) (latest available). The government likely has access to more current population data, so totals might differ ever so slightly.

Please keep all of this in mind as we track the progress of the [Re-opening Plans](#reopening) milestones.

### The Fine Print

We include fine print at the bottom of the dashboard to explain calculations, etc. It's likely too difficult to read in some cases, so here's a copy of it:

>All data sourced from bulletins and dashboards at [gov.mb.ca/covid19](https://gov.mb.ca/covid19). Provincial case data sourced from [ici.radio-canada.ca](https://ici.radio-canada.ca). <sup>1</sup>Estimated off of the last 10 days new cases. <sup>2</sup>Last 10 days new cases per capita (as of yesterday).

## About Us

_Last updated: June 12, 2021_

The _Manitoba COVID-19 Updates_ account/site is completely volunteer run. It is **not** affiliated with the Manitoba government in any way. It was started in January, 2021. Throughout the second wave, I became very frustrated with how difficult it was to access, read, and understand the updates and news about COVID. The straw that broke the camel's back was the incredibly backlogged "active" case count. At one point, the official count was as much as double what the likely reality was (e.g. count was around 10,000 when it was likely closer to 5,000). On January 5, 2021, we published our first daily update, and over the past several months, have grown significantly in social media followers (THANK YOU!).

### Private/Direct Messages

I do my best to answer as many people as possible, but I am one person and don't have the time and all the answers to get to everyone. I apologize if I haven't replied to your private messages in the past (or future). As the following grows bigger and bigger, it's even harder to keep up. I am hoping that this website resource will help answer many questions people ask me privately so they can get answers faster.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Here's the beginning of a list of questions that are frequently asked...

### Why don't you emphasize the Test Positivity Rate?

While helpful to use as a partial indicator, an over-emphasis on the 5-day test positivity rate can easily skew things when looked at on its own. For example, throughout the summer of 2020, lots of asymptomatic testing was done, which waters down the percentage (no problem here). During the second wave, asymptomatic testing was mostly canceled, and with huge delays at testing sites, people with minor symptoms likely didn't bother going to get tested, meaning the TPR would skyrocket as it did. Even once the dust settled getting closer to Christmas, the TPR remained very high. However, the number of tests remained very low. Again, nothing wrong here per se. The trouble is that you can't have a reliable measurement when you are changing the parameters all the time, and you also can't rely on something that has massive external factors like people's feelings and opinions. For example, if people are panicked (like in the first wave), you're much more likely to have a higher rate of people going for tests. As people become desensitized and adjusted to the pandemic, you might find people are a bit more relaxed about getting tested. And this does not even factor in regions where there's a higher percentage of people that do not believe COVID is real/a concern. In areas like this, many people with moderate symptoms may be unlikely to get tested. The only data that can't be skewed is hospitalization and deaths, or something like wastewater testing.

## Future

_Last updated: June 17, 2021_

In these challenging times, it's no surprise that I receive tons of anxious and curious questions about the current situation and what the future holds. This will be a growing section where I will attempt to provide answers to some hard questions.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE ARE PERSONAL OPINIONS BASED ON EXISTING EVIDENCE/INFORMATION AND NONE ARE GUARANTEED**

### When will children under the age of 12 be able to get vaccinated?

On May 5, 2021, Pfizer was the first to be approved in children ages 12-17, and currently leads the way in this area. Pfizer is currently testing on children age 6 months - 11 years, which has been divided into three age groups: ages 5 to 11, 2 to 5, and 6 months to 2 years. Larger trials have already begun with the age 5 to 11 group, and it's expected to be complete in September. The shots will continue to be given in a two-dose regimen. People age 12+ currently receive 2 doses of 30 micrograms each. Age 5-11 will be given 10 micrograms doses, and 6 months - 4 years will receive 3 micrograms doses.

**Prediction:** Canada will probably approve Pfizer for age 5-11 in the fall, as early as mid September, as late as October. We already have adequate vaccine supply now with the recent large Moderna shipments and ongoing Pfizer supply. Everyone who wants a vaccine will very likely have it before the end of July. People will continue to get vaccines throughout summer, but there will no longer be any pressure for booking restrictions, etc. Between July and September, Canada/Manitoba will likely be able to stockpile Pfizer vaccines to prepare for a rollout in schools in the fall. Children under 5 may likely be approved in late 2020 or early 2021.

>In addition, the pediatric study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine in children 6 months to 11 years of age is ongoing. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to have definitive readouts and, subject to the data generated, submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (e.g., in the U.S.) or a variation to Conditional Marketing Authorizations (e.g., in the EU) for two cohorts, including children 2-5 years of age and 5-11 years of age, in September. The readout and submission for the cohort of children 6 months to 2 years of age are expected in the fourth quarter.

>If safety and immunogenicity is confirmed, and pending authorization or approval from regulators, we hope to submit the vaccine for potential Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sometime in the September-October timeframe for children 5 to 11, and soon after for 6 months to 5.
