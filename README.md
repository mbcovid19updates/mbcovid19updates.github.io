## Treatment

_Last updated: June 23, 2022_

### Treatment for Adults

Adults may be eligible for COVID-19 treatment if you meet all of the following:

- have developed symptoms that began in the last 5 to 7 days
- have tested positive for COVID-19
- are at higher risk of severe outcomes

You may be considered at higher risk of severe outcomes if you:

- are not fully vaccinated
- have not received a booster dose
- have not been previously infected with COVID-19
- are an older adult - your risk increases with age
- have one or more chronic medical conditions
- are moderately to severely immunocompromised, due to a medical condition or treatment
- are obese
- are pregnant

Depending on your age and health status, you may still be considered at higher risk of developing severe outcomes - even if you have received all of the COVID-19 vaccine doses that you are eligible for.

If you are 18 or older and meet these eligibility criteria, talk with your health care provider or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) to see if COVID-19 treatment is right for you.

Different treatments must be given within either 5 or 7 days of symptom onset, so you must seek treatment quickly to be eligible.

### Treatment for Youth/Children

People younger than 18 may qualify for COVID-19 treatment if they have symptoms that began within the previous 5 to 7 days, have tested positive for COVID-19, and meet the criteria in one of these two categories.

#### Category 1

- are immunocompromised due to a medical condition or treatment (regardless of whether you are vaccinated or previously infected with COVID-19)

#### Category 2

- are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated AND
- have no prior history of COVID-19 infection AND
- have a serious health condition, which may include diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, lung disease or liver disease.

COVID-19 treatment is not a substitute for vaccination. Getting vaccinated is your best defense against the virus.

More information about COVID-19 treatment is available at [manitoba.ca/covid19/treatment](https://www.manitoba.ca/covid19/treatment/).

All people in Manitoba aged 6 months and older are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. This page provides information about vaccine eligibility and recommendations on the type of vaccine people should receive. If you have questions about your individual circumstances, including your individual risks and benefits of vaccination, please speak with your health care provider.

### Vaccine Eligibility

The [Manitoba COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility Criteria](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/eligibility-criteria.html) website page is informative, so we encourage you to visit the [official site directly](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/eligibility-criteria.html) for the latest information:

- [Children aged 6 months - 4 years](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/eligibility-criteria.html#infants)

### Immunization Card

As of March 1, 2022, Manitoba's proof of vaccination requirements are no longer in place. Some businesses / venues may choose to continue to require proof of immunization for access. Manitoba's immunization card and verifier app will continue to be available for this purpose.

Manitobans can demonstrate proof of their COVID-19 immunization with either the Manitoba Immunization Card issued by the Government of Manitoba or the Pan-Canadian Proof of Vaccination Credential issued by the Government of Canada.

For more information about proof of vaccine cards for residents, businesses or visitors, please visit the [Manitoba Immunization Card](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/immunizationrecord/index.html) website.

## Prevention & Assessing Risk

_Last updated: June 23, 2022_

As Manitoba shifts from public health orders to public health recommendations, it is important to remember that there are still many measures that we can take to protect ourselves and each other. Following public health guidance and understanding situations where there is a greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 can help you stay safe and protect others.

Please visit the [Manitoba COVID-19 Prevention and Assessing Risk](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/prevention-assessing-risk.html) website for information.

## Daily Dashboards

_Last updated: June 23, 2022_

As of end of March, Manitoba has switched to weekly reporting and includes less details and breakdowns of the data that used to be available. Current hospitalizations and ICU patient counts are also no longer available, but the data is now presented as the total number of _new_ patients admitted to the hospital and ICU for that _1 week period_. Each week, we comb through the official COVID data and present it as a single unified dashboard, offering an easy-to-read and intuitive experience for understanding the current situation in Manitoba. Here's an overview of every part of the daily dashboards and where/how we make calculations.

### Current Data Sources

- [Official Provincial Respiratory Surveillance Report](https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/surveillance/covid-19/index.html)
- [Official Manitoba News Bulletins](https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html)

### Descriptions & Calculations

#### (1) Hospital
This is the total number of **new** patients (including ICU patients) that were admitted to the hospital and tested positive for COVID during this 1-week period. It's been reported in the past that a portion of these patients were admitted for other reasons and incidentally tested positive for COVID (as in, they were not necessarily there _due_ to COVID). The last number mentioned by the province was only 35% were there _due_ to COVID in late February.

The smaller number is the total number of hospital admissions due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.


#### (2) ICU
This is the total number of **new** patients that were admitted to the ICU and tested positive for COVID during this 1-week period. It's been reported in the past that a portion of these patients were admitted for other reasons and incidentally tested positive for COVID (as in, they were not necessarily there _due_ to COVID). The last number mentioned by the province was 65% were there _due_ to COVID in late February.

The smaller number is the total number of ICU admissions due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.


#### (3) Deaths
This is the total number of **new** deaths that were reported for the previous 1-week period. While the weekly reports by public health are delayed by 1 week, we further delay the death data by another week in order to get the most reliable picture possible. Due to the stringent measures taken to classify, verify and report deaths due to COVID, it can sometimes take 2 or more weeks before they're reported. For example, one week's report indicated a total of `5` deaths happened during that period, but the next week indicated that same week had 7 more deaths retroactively added to it. Without delaying the death reporting by 1 more week, it would always look like death outcomes are much better than they are.

As of March 15, 2022 a death is defined as follows:

>COVID-19 associated deaths are defined as all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases who have died 30 days after the earliest specimen collection date in the most recent investigation; or where COVID-19 infection was diagnosed post-mortem. Note that the reason for death does not have to be attributable to COVID-19. A positive laboratory test is sufficient for reporting.

Prior to March 15, 2022:
_Source: Adapted from [WHO International Guidelines for Certification and Classification (coding) of COVID-19 as a cause of death](https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf)_

>A death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery* from COVID-19 between illness and death.
>
>*Recovery in this context means no residual effects or complications from COVID-19, and does not refer to the status of "recovered", which refers to clients who are off isolation or precautions and are no longer considered infectious

The smaller number is the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.


#### Vaccination Data

As of June, 2022, vaccination data is no longer reported in a way that we can share as stats, so this has been removed from the dashboard.
