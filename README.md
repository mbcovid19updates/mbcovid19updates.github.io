## Vaccine Eligibility

_Last updated: June 9, 2021_

This is a summary of current vaccine eligibility. We do our best to keep it up to date, but you can also view the [Official Vaccine Eligibility](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/eligibility-criteria.html) information page on the Manitoba website.

### First Doses

- **Anyone age 12 and up** is eligible to receive their first dose of a COVID vaccine.
   - Young people aged 12 to 17 must receive _Pfizer_ for both doses, as this is currently the only vaccine approved for use in this age group.

### Second Doses

Due to current supply constraints, Manitoba is not able to provide the second dose at the recommended intervals. In an effort to get more people with some amount of vaccine protection, second doses were delayed for most people. Please note that there is no danger in receiving your second dose later. In fact, studies have shown that going longer in between doses offers better efficacy. Manitoba currently has a multi-tiered approach to prioritizing second doses.

You are eligible to receive your second dose if <u>any</u> of the following apply:

- You have priority health conditions ([see list here](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/eligibility-criteria.html#criteria)).
- You are Indigenous
- You received your first dose of vaccine **on or before May 4, 2021**.

**AND**

- You received your first dose a minimum number of days ago:
   - Pfizer (minimum of 21 days ago)
   - Moderna (minimum of 28 days ago)
   - AstraZeneca (minimum of 28 days ago, but 8 weeks ago recommended)

### How to Book an Appointment

Appointments for first or second doses of vaccines can be booked at any super-site, pop-up clinic, or a doctor's office or pharmacy that is accepting appointments. Super-sites are by far the most efficient and easiest way to book an appointment.

- To book a vaccine appointment at a super-site or pop-up clinic by phone, call 1-844-MAN-VACC (1-844-626-8222).
- To book a vaccine appointment at a super-site or pop-up clinic online, [visit the booking website here](https://patient.petalmd.com/login?groupId=6032).
   - You'll need to create an account with your email address and your 9-digit personal health identification number (PHIN) on your Manitoba Health Card.
   - You can link more than one person to the same account, so that you can also book for family members and loved ones.
   - If you don't have an email address or health card number, you'll need to call by phone instead: 1-844-626-8222 (1-844-MAN-VACC)
   - Daily hours of operation are from 6:00am to 8:00pm.
- To book a vaccine appointment at a doctor's office or pharmacy, you'll need to contact them directly. To find available locations, [visit the Vaccine Finder tool](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/finder.html).
- If you are a senior or have mobility issues and need help getting to your appointment at a clinic or pharmacy, call 211 for available transportation options in your area.

### AstraZeneca Information

If your first dose of vaccine was AstraZeneca, please note that limited supplies exist. All people with AstraZeneca as first dose are now recommended to receive Pfizer or Moderna as their second dose. This has been proven safe and even offers a higher level of protection compared to receiving a second dose of AstraZeneca. It's recommended that you wait a minimum of 8 weeks before receiving your second dose of any of the vaccines, but you may receive one as early as 28 days from first dose. If you strongly wish to receive a second dose of AstraZeneca, the province announced (June 9, 2021) more doses are arriving soon.

### Mixing Vaccines

Studies have shown that it is safe to mix vaccines. Due to limited supply of AstraZeneca, people with their first dose of AstraZeneca are recommended to receive their second dose as Pfizer or Moderna. If you received Pfizer as your first dose, you may also receive Moderna as your second dose and vice versa, though it is recommended to stick with the same mRNA vaccine wherever possible.

### Consent Forms

You will need to fill out and print a consent form for first and second dose appointments. Filling out the form in advance will also make it faster for you to get your vaccine. [Click here to download, fill out and print the consent forms](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/resources.html#forms).

If you cannot print out a consent form, there will be some available at the vaccination site/clinic.

<a href="https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/resources.html#form" class="button">Download and Print Consent Form</a>

### Received your vaccine outside of Manitoba?

Individuals who received their COVID-19 vaccine outside of the province should have their vaccination information added into Manitoba's immunization system. In order to do this, you will need proof of immunization from the jurisdiction where you received your vaccine.

If the vaccine you received is eligible for use in Canada, you can then bring this proof of immunization to a public health office. The office will enter this information to ensure that your primary care physician and our public health teams can have access to your immunization records.

### Vaccine Lottery

_Last updated: June 10, 2021_

The Manitoba government is launching a new province-wide lottery that will award nearly $2 million in cash and scholarships this summer to encourage Manitobans to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible.

All Manitobans aged 12 and up who have received at least one dose of vaccine by August 2 will be eligible for the first draw. All Manitobans aged 12 and up who have received two doses by September 6 will be eligible for the second draw.

Anyone who has been immunized by these deadlines will automatically be entered. Each draw will award:

- 3 prizes of **$100,000** in the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority (excluding Churchill), for a total of $300,000.
- 1 **$100,000** prize in each of these regional health authorities, for a total of $400,000:
   - Prairie Mountain Health;
   - Southern Health–Santé Sud;
   - Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority; and
   - Northern Regional Health Authority (including Churchill).
- 10 **$25,000** scholarships for young people aged 12 to 17 across the province, for a total of $250,000.

To see the full details of this announcement, [view the link here](https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=51427&posted=2021-06-09).

#### What is the purpose of the Manitoba Vaccination Lottery?
Vaccination is the fastest way to overcome COVID-19 and help Manitobans return to the activities they love. The Manitoba Vaccination Lottery provides an incentive for people who have chosen to get the vaccine.

#### Who is eligible?
Anyone who receives their first dose of vaccine by Aug. 2 is eligible for the first draw, and anyone who has received two doses by Sept. 6 is eligible for the second draw. Additional details about the process will be provided before the end of June.

## COVID Symptoms & Testing

_Last updated: June 10, 2021_

### Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 may include any of the following:

- Fever/Chills
- Cough
- Sore throat/hoarse voice
- Difficulty breathing
- Loss of taste or smell
- Vomiting, diarrhea for more than 24 hours
- Runny nose
- Muscle aches
- Fatigue
- Pink eye (conjunctivitis)
- Headache
- Skin rash of unknown cause
- Poor feeding in an infant
- Nausea or loss of appetite

While many people will develop only mild symptoms, some groups appear to be more vulnerable to COVID-19. Those at higher risk typically develop more serious, even fatal, symptoms such as pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and kidney failure.

### High risk groups for COVID-19

High risk groups for COVID-19 include people:

- 60 years of age and older
- Living with chronic health conditions (e.g. diabetes, heart, renal or chronic lung conditions)
- With weakened immune systems (e.g. cancer)

**Symptoms of COVID-19 or other coronaviruses may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the virus.**

### When should I get Tested?
Testing should be done **as soon as possible once symptoms appear**. You should still be tested even if your symptoms are very mild or if they start to improve after 24 hours. It is important to get tested as soon as symptoms appear, as tracing and isolating contacts in a timely manner is important to limiting the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

If you have **one symptom listed in column A**, OR **two or more symptoms listed in column B**, you should immediately isolate yourself and [use the online screening tool](https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/screening-tool/) or call **Health Links - Info Santé** (204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257) for further instructions, including where to go for testing and/or assessment.

Symptoms **A** | Symptoms **B**
--- | ---
Fever/Chills | Runny nose
Cough | Muscle aches
Sore throat/hoarse voice | Fatigue
Shortness of breath/difficulty breathing | Pink eye (conjunctivitis)
Loss of taste or smell | Headache
Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 24 hours | Skin rash of unknown cause
&nbsp; | Poor feeding if an infant
&nbsp; | Nausea or loss of appetite

<a href="https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/screening-tool/" class="button">COVID-19 Online Screening Tool</a>

If you choose to not get tested, you will need to isolate for at least 10 days, and until you no longer have fever for 24 hours and your other symptoms have resolved. If you have travelled or been exposed to a case, you should continue to self-isolate (quarantine) for the remainder of the 14-day period.

<a name="variants"></a>
## Variants of Concern

_Last updated: June 10, 2021_

All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, some changes may affect the virus’s properties, such as how easily it spreads, the associated disease severity, or the performance of vaccines, therapeutic medicines, diagnostic tools, or other public health and social measures.

For more information about Variants of Concern, visit the [WHO website](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).

In Manitoba, we currently track the following Variants of Concern:

WHO label | Lineage | Origin | Earliest Sample Date | Designation Date
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Alpha** | B.1.1.7 | United Kingdom | September, 2020 | December 18, 2020
**Beta** | B.1.351 | South Africa | May, 2020 | December 18, 2020
**Gamma** | P.1 | Brazil | November, 2020 | January 11, 2021
**Delta** | B.1.617.2 | India | October, 2020 | May 11, 2021

There are also several other **variants of <u>interest</u>** that are being monitored right now, and may eventually become **variants of <u>concern</u>**.

Currently, the **Alpha** (B.1.1.7 / UK) variant is the dominant strain, suspected to account for roughly 60% of all new COVID cases in Manitoba (_as of June 10, 2021_). Manitoba does not currently have the capacity to sequence the exact strain of every last COVID case, so in many cases (over half), they are labeled as "unspecified", but assumed to be the **Alpha** (B.1.1.7 / UK) variant. Based on the evidence so far, researchers believe the **Alpha** variant is much more contagious and more deadlier than other variants, resulting in more younger people ending up in the hospital and an increase in ICU hospitalizations.

Recently, the **Delta** (B.1.617.2 / India) variant has been discovered in Manitoba, and is reported to be as much as twice as contagious as the **Alpha** variant, and more likely to evade current vaccines. This variant is expected to eventually become the new dominant strain in time.

### Will the Vaccine protect against Variants?

All approved vaccines in Canada are proven to be effective against the variants of concern, but studies suggest that 1 dose may not offer robust enough protection against the new **Delta** variant. This is why many provinces, including Manitoba, have quickly switched back to prioritizing giving out second doses of the vaccine.

### Will Public Health notify me if I have a Variant of Concern?

Since the **Alpha** (B.1.1.7 / UK) variant is currently the dominant strain, it's now assumed that all cases are likely the **Alpha** variant unless otherwise proven. Because of this, Manitoba Public Health will no longer notify you if your positive COVID test ends up being the **Alpha** variant (you will still be notified if you test positive of COVID). If your positive COVID test ends up being a different variant of concern (after sequencing, which could be a couple of days later), public health will likely notify you.
