## Current Recommendations

_Last updated: March 15, 2022_

Effective March 15, 2022, all remaining public health restrictions have been removed.

Public health continues to <u>recommend</u> (no longer require) people isolate in the following situations:

- People with symptoms should stay home and isolate for 5 days after symptoms start until they have no fever and other symptoms have improved over the past 24 hours.
- Individuals who have tested positive but do not develop symptoms should isolate for 5 days from the date of the test.
- Individuals should wear a well-fitting, well-made mask if they must have contact with other people while ill or when their isolation is finished for 10 days after the onset of symptoms or test date if asymptomatic.
- People who have symptoms or test positive should avoid non-essential visits with higher-risk people or at higher-risk settings for 10 days after the onset of their symptoms or test date if asymptomatic.

To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is recommended Manitobans get vaccinated, stay home when sick, assess their risk and make decisions about using masks, physical distancing and other actions based on those risks.

Manitobans are encouraged to learn if they are eligible for COVID-19 treatment. Treatment can help protect against severe illness or hospitalization but must be given within days of having symptoms, so it is important to get tested quickly to access this care. Vaccinated and unvaccinated people, including those with chronic health conditions, who are pregnant or have other risk factors, may be eligible for treatment. More information about COVID-19 treatment is available at [manitoba.ca/covid19/treatment](https://www.manitoba.ca/covid19/treatment/).

## Vaccine Eligibility

_Last updated: April 4, 2022_

This is a summary of current vaccine eligibility. We do our best to keep it up to date, but you can also view the [Official Vaccine Eligibility](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/eligibility-criteria.html) information page on the Manitoba website.


### First Doses

- **Anyone aged 5 and up** is eligible to receive their first dose of a COVID vaccine.
   - Young people aged 5-11 must receive a special pediatric (smaller) dose of _Pfizer_ for both doses, as this is currently the only vaccine approved for use in this age group.


### Second Doses

- **Anyone** who has had their first dose of a COVID vaccine is eligible to receive their second dose after a minimum of 28 days since first dose. Following guidance from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, Manitoba is now **recommending individuals receive their second dose of vaccine 56 days (eight weeks) after their first dose**. The longer time period between doses has been shown to provide a stronger immune response over time. However, the minimum time frame between first and second doses will remain at 28 days so individuals will be able to choose the timing of vaccine schedule based on their own circumstances.
   - People age 18+ may choose either mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) as their second dose, regardless of which vaccine they received for first dose.
   - Young people under the age of 12 must receive _Pfizer_ for both doses, as this is currently the only vaccine approved for use in this age group.


### Third/Booster Dose

- **Anyone aged 50+** and a minimum of **5 months** after their second dose.
- **Individuals aged 18+ who live in a First Nations community** and a minimum of **5 months** after their second dose.
- **Anyone aged 18+** and a minimum of **6 months** after their second dose.
    - You will need a prescription from a doctor if you are requesting your third dose earlier than 6 months because you are moderately to severely immunocompromised or because you require it for travel purposes. Individuals who are unsure of the date of their last immunization can check their record here.
- **Youth aged 12-17** at a high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and a minimum of **6 months** after their second dose:
    - Have underlying medical conditions.
    - Belong to racialized or marginalized communities that are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.
    - Live in shelters, group homes, or correctional facilities.


### Youth & Adults who are Immunocompromised

Youth and adults who are moderately to severely immunocompromised are recommended to receive a total of 4 COVID-19 vaccine doses. In these situations, the third dose requires a prescription and must be given at least 28 days after the second dose. The fourth dose should be given:

- 5 months after the third dose for individuals aged 50+.
- 5 months after the third dose for individuals aged 18+ who live in a First Nations community.
- 6 months after the third dose all other youth and adults.


### Immunization after a COVID-19 infection

It is recommended that Manitobans who have been infected with COVID-19 wait 2-3 months before getting a booster dose. This follows the latest guidance from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. People who prefer to get their booster dose sooner, or if their primary care provider recommends a booster sooner, can do so.

### Vaccination Status

If you've been vaccinated, you can check the status of your vaccination online. It usually shows up within a day or two, but could take several days. Once you've received both doses of vaccine, be sure to [apply for the Immunization Card](#vaccine-cards).

### Vaccine Records Missing? Or received your vaccine outside of Manitoba?

_Last updated: July 2, 2021_

People can now call 1-844-MAN-VACC (1-844-626-8222) to update any missing or inaccurate information on their immunization records. Individuals just need to call and follow the prompts to get the update process started.

Alternatively, individuals can [complete the e-form to update their immunization information](https://forms.gov.mb.ca/covid-immunization-record-request/).

### Vaccine Cards

_Last updated: March 1, 2022_

As of March 1, 2022, the proof of vaccination requirement has been lifted. It is still available for now, if some businesses or events wish to continue using it.

Fully vaccinated Manitobans are now able to receive Immunization cards. The digital and physical cards contain no personal health information or data. Rather, the cards only show the person’s first and last names and a QR code. When scanned, the QR code will show the person is fully vaccinated.

#### How to Apply

Two weeks after receiving a second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Manitobans may apply for the card using the new online portal at [immunizationcard.manitoba.ca](https://immunizationcard.manitoba.ca).

<a href="https://immunizationcard.manitoba.ca" class="button">Apply for Immunization Card</a>

**NOTE:** Unvaccinated children under the age of 12 may attend/visit the above events (where applicable) if accompanied by a fully vaccinated member of their household.

#### Eligibility

To be eligible to receive an immunization card, Manitobans must:

- have a Manitoba health card.
- have received two doses of a vaccine.
- wait 14 days after getting the second dose of vaccine.

Individuals who receive a dose of an mRNA vaccine following one or two doses of a vaccine not approved by Health Canada, but approved by the World Health Organization, will be considered fully immunized. Individuals can have their immunization record updated to include vaccines not approved by Health Canada at https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/immunizationrecord/residents.html#immunization-records.

## Daily Dashboards

_Last updated: April 4, 2022_

As of end of March, Manitoba has switched to weekly reporting and includes less details and breakdowns of the data that used to be available. Current hospitalizations and ICU patient counts are also no longer available, but the data is now presented as the total number of _new_ patients admitted to the hospital and ICU for that _1 week period_. Each week, we comb through the official COVID data and present it as a single unified dashboard, offering an easy-to-read and intuitive experience for understanding the current situation in Manitoba. Here's an overview of every part of the daily dashboards and where/how we make calculations.

### Current Data Sources

- [Official Provincial Respiratory Surveillance Report](https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/surveillance/covid-19/index.html)
- [Official Manitoba News Bulletins](https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html)

### Descriptions & Calculations

#### (1) Hospital
This is the total number of **new** patients (including ICU patients) that were admitted to the hospital and tested positive for COVID during this 1-week period. It's been reported in the past that a portion of these patients were admitted for other reasons and incidentally tested positive for COVID (as in, they were not necessarily there _due_ to COVID). The last number mentioned by the province was only 35% were there _due_ to COVID in late February.

The smaller number is the total number of hospital admissions due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.


#### (2) ICU
This is the total number of **new** patients that were admitted to the ICU and tested positive for COVID during this 1-week period. It's been reported in the past that a portion of these patients were admitted for other reasons and incidentally tested positive for COVID (as in, they were not necessarily there _due_ to COVID). The last number mentioned by the province was 65% were there _due_ to COVID in late February.

The smaller number is the total number of ICU admissions due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.


#### (3) Deaths
This is the total number of **new** deaths that were reported for the previous 1-week period. While the weekly reports by public health are delayed by 1 week, we further delay the death data by another week in order to get the most reliable picture possible. Due to the stringent measures taken to classify, verify and report deaths due to COVID, it can sometimes take 2 or more weeks before they're reported. For example, one week's report indicated a total of `5` deaths happened during that period, but the next week indicated that same week had 7 more deaths retroactively added to it. Without delaying the death reporting by 1 more week, it would always look like death outcomes are much better than they are.

As of March 15, 2022 a death is defined as follows:

>COVID-19 associated deaths are defined as all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases who have died 30 days after the earliest specimen collection date in the most recent investigation; or where COVID-19 infection was diagnosed post-mortem. Note that the reason for death does not have to be attributable to COVID-19. A positive laboratory test is sufficient for reporting.

Prior to March 15, 2022:
_Source: Adapted from [WHO International Guidelines for Certification and Classification (coding) of COVID-19 as a cause of death](https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf)_

>A death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery* from COVID-19 between illness and death.
>
>*Recovery in this context means no residual effects or complications from COVID-19, and does not refer to the status of "recovered", which refers to clients who are off isolation or precautions and are no longer considered infectious

The smaller number is the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.


#### (4) Vaccinations

As of April, 2022 reporting, the only vaccine data available is broken down as the total percentage of Manitoba residents that have recieved a first, second and third dose of vaccine. No other data is available.

## About Us

_Last updated: June 29, 2021_

The _Manitoba COVID-19 Updates_ account/site is completely volunteer run. We receive no funding, we make no money. We're fueled by your positive feedback and when you share our social media accounts with others. It is **not** affiliated with the Manitoba government in any way. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I found myself wanting to help serve Manitoba in a meaningful way. Not going to give any excuses, but that didn't quite happen during the first year. Then in January, 2021 (better late than never!), I saw an opportunity. I am a designer and project manager by trade, and throughout the second wave I became very frustrated with how difficult it was to access, read, and understand the updates and news about COVID in Manitoba. On January 5, 2021, we published our first daily update, and over the past several months have grown significantly in social media followers (THANK YOU!).

### Private/Direct Messages

I do my best to answer as many people as possible, but I am one person with a regular full time job and family and don't have the time and all the answers to get to everyone. I apologize if I haven't replied to your private messages in the past (or future). As the following grows bigger and bigger, it's even harder to keep up. I built this website resource in hopes that it will help answer many questions people ask me privately so they can get answers faster.
