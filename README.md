- Individuals identified as having COVID-19 must immediately enter mandatory isolation until public health officials advise they can end isolation.
- Close contacts of a person or persons with COVID-19, unless otherwise exempt, must immediately go into mandatory self-isolation (quarantine) for 10 days, followed by 4 days of self-monitoring for symptoms, from the last date of exposure.

If the close contact develops symptoms, all household members, unless otherwise exempt, should self-isolate (quarantine) until the symptomatic individual receives their COVID-19 test result.
- Close contacts and household members of close contacts may be exempt from self-isolation (quarantine) if they have no symptoms AND are fully immunized at the time of the exposure or have had a COVID-19 infection within the past 6 months. Public health officials will let close contacts know if they meet criteria for exemption from self-isolation (quarantine).

Travellers, who are not exempt from quarantine, must observe the full 14-day self-isolation period regardless of symptoms and test results. Re-testing is advised if an asymptomatic individual develops symptoms at any point, unless the individual had already tested positive. Individuals who test positive for COVID-19 and have had close contact to a traveller should identify this contact to public health during the public health investigation and follow-up.
- Testing as a result of domestic travel is not required for individuals who are exempt from quarantine in the provincial public health orders.
- See the [State of Emergency and Current Public Health Orders](https://www.manitoba.ca/covid19/prs/orders/index.html#self-isolation) page for more information and exemptions to self-isolation.

<a name="masks"></a>
## Mask Mandate

_Last updated: August 30, 2021_

A person who enters or remains in an indoor public place must wear a mask in a manner that covers their mouth, nose and chin without gapping. An indoor public space includes:

- any part of a retail store where the public has access;
- any part of the common areas of a residential building;
- a health care facility;
- an educational institution or facility;
- an elevator;
- a motor vehicle used for public transportation, including a bus, taxi, limousine or other vehicle for hire; and
- a bus shelter, pedestrian tunnel or enclosed pedestrian walkway.

The operator of an indoor public place must ensure that every person who is not wearing a mask while in the indoor public place is given a reminder to do so as soon as possible following entry.

Masks are not required if people are seated at least two metres from others, or if there is a non-permeable physical barrier, such as a plexiglass barrier. However, people need to wear a mask at all times while moving to or from their seated position within the indoor public place.

In addition, employees, contractors or operators of an indoor public place do not need to wear a mask while they are in an area where members of the public do not normally have access, or if they are behind a non-permeable physical barrier, including a plexiglass barrier.

People can temporarily remove their mask while in an indoor public place:

- to receive a service that requires the removal of their mask,
- to consume food or drink;
- to deal with an emergency or medical purpose, or
- to establish their identity.

People who do not have to wear masks include:

- a child who is under five years of age;
- a person with a medical condition that is unrelated to COVID-19, including breathing or cognitive difficulties or a disability, which prevents them from safely wearing a mask;
- a person who is swimming or engaged in other athletic activities; and
- a person who is unable to put on or remove a mask without the assistance of another person.

#### What is considered an indoor public space?

An indoor public space includes:

- any part of a retail store where the public has access;
- any part of the common areas of a residential building;
- a health care facility;
- an educational institution or facility;
- an elevator;
- a motor vehicle used for public transportation, including a bus, taxi , limousine or other vehicle for hire; and
- a bus shelter, pedestrian tunnel or enclosed pedestrian walkway.

This order does not apply to a child care centre or a child care home.

## Vaccine Eligibility

_Last updated: October 27, 2021_

This is a summary of current vaccine eligibility. We do our best to keep it up to date, but you can also view the [Official Vaccine Eligibility](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/eligibility-criteria.html) information page on the Manitoba website.

### First Doses

- **Anyone born on or before December 31, 2009** (roughly age 11½ and up) is eligible to receive their first dose of a COVID vaccine.
   - Young people under the age of 18 must receive _Pfizer_ for both doses, as this is currently the only vaccine approved for use in this age group.

### Second Doses

- **Anyone** who has had their first dose of a COVID vaccine is eligible to receive their second dose after a minimum of 28 days since first dose.
   - People age 18+ may choose either mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) as their second dose, regardless of which vaccine they received for first dose.
   - Young people under the age of 18 must receive _Pfizer_ for both doses, as this is currently the only vaccine approved for use in this age group.
   - If AstraZeneca was your first dose, an 8-12 week interval is recommended, but can be as low as 28 days.

### Third Doses

The third dose should be given at least six months after the last vaccine (or no nearlier than 28 days since 2nd dose in certain circumstances):

- Residents of congregate elderly persons housing.
- First Nations people living on reserve.
- Individuals who have only received a viral vector vaccine (2 doses of AstraZeneca or 1 dose of Janssen). Does not apply to people with an mRNA vaccine.
- Health care personnel who have direct contact with patients, residents or clients.
- People who are **moderately to severely immunocompromised** due to a medical condition and/or treatment.
    - This includes those who:
        - are receiving active chemotherapy (or immunotherapy) for cancer
        - have received a solid organ transplant and are currently receiving chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy
        - were born with moderate or severe dysfunction of their immune system
        - are living with untreated or advanced HIV-AIDS
        - are taking certain medications that severely affect the immune system
    - The following people should talk to their doctor about the risks and benefits of an additional dose:
        - receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis
        - on the list to receive a solid organ transplant
        - have a ventricular assist device.
    - People who are immunocompromised can be immunized by their health care provider.
- Individuals who have received one or two doses of a **vaccine that is not approved by Health Canada**.
    - Additional doses for people who have previously been vaccinated with vaccines not approved by Health Canada can be administered at supersites, pop-ups or mobile clinics, or by a health care provider.
- Residents of all personal care homes.
- Residents and staff of First Nation personal care homes.
- Individuals who wish to receive a third dose for **travel purposes**.
    - People who are travelling who have specific vaccination requirements as per their destination, will need to visit a licensed physician to talk about the risks and benefits of vaccination.
    - The likely scenario here would be if the country you're visiting does not currently consider your mixed vaccines as valid, e.g. 1 AstraZeneca + 1 Moderna. By receiving a third dose (2nd dose of Moderna), this may satisfy other countries with stricter rules.
    - Individuals who would like to receive a third dose for travel purposes must be vaccinated by their health care provider and go through an informed consent process or present a prescription to a pharmacist.


#### How to access a Third Dose

Scenario | All COVID-19 vaccine clinics | Medical Clinics | Community Pharmacies
--- | --- | --- | ---
For people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised | ✅ (requires a prescription from a licensed physician) | ✅ Note: If your physician is not administering the vaccine, request documentation to share with another physician or pharmacist. | ✅ (prescription not required but recommended)
For people who are travelling who have specific travel requirements, as per their destination | ✅ (requires a prescription from a licensed physician) | ✅ | ✅ (requires a prescription from a licensed physician)
For people who have received one or two doses of a vaccine that is not approved by Health Canada | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
Health care personnel | ✅ (at least 6 months after last dose) | ✅ (at least 6 months after last dose) | ✅ (at least 6 months after last dose)
For people with two doses of Astra Zeneca or one dose of Janssen | ✅ (at least 6 months after last dose) | ✅ (at least 6 months after last dose) | ✅ (at least 6 months after last dose)

### Medical Exemptions

For the vast majority of people, the COVID-19 vaccine is a safe and effective way to protect themselves and others against the virus.

However, there is a very small number of people who can’t or shouldn’t be immunized. If you feel that you may qualify for a medical exemption based on the criteria listed below, the first step is to schedule an appointment with your own health care provider and/or your specialist. 

They will review the exemption criteria with you to determine if you may qualify. Only a specialist physician can request a medical exemption from the province, based on your medical history. Individuals cannot submit their own requests for exemption.Once it is submitted, information about the exemption will be entered into the provincial immunization database, including whether the exemption is permanent or temporary.   

Exempt people will be able to request their digital or physical Manitoba immunization card approximately seven to 14 business days after their exemption is submitted. The card and the display shown after scanning the QR code will be identical to those currently used by fully immunized people. This will help protect the private health information of exempt individuals, while also keeping a simple, consistent process for venues and events that must validate immunization status. 

#### Criteria
- Had a severe reaction after the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (e.g. myocarditis, Guillain-Barré syndrome).
- Are receiving treatment that affects their ability to mount an immune response, meaning vaccination must be timed carefully with their treatment schedule (e.g. receiving immunocompromising treatment after a transplant, certain types of cancer treatments).
- Had a severe allergy or anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or its components that cannot be managed by the Health Sciences Centre Allergy Clinic.

### How to Book an Appointment

Appointments for first or second doses of vaccines can be booked at any super-site, pop-up clinic, or a doctor's office or pharmacy that is accepting appointments. Super-sites are by far the most efficient and easiest way to book an appointment.

### AstraZeneca Information

_Last updated: July 27, 2021_

All people with AstraZeneca as first dose are now recommended to receive Pfizer or Moderna as their second dose. This has been proven safe and even offers a higher level of protection compared to receiving a second dose of AstraZeneca. It's recommended that you wait a minimum of 8 weeks before receiving your second dose of any of the vaccines, but you may receive one as early as 28 days from first dose.

If you strongly wish to receive a second dose of AstraZeneca, there are a total of 15 medical clinics and pharmacies that are acting as regional hubs to offer second-dose AstraZeneca vaccinations. You can use the [online vaccine finder](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/finder.html) to find a location with available doses.

#### Locations with AstraZeneca

The following medical clinics and pharmacies in the province have received AstraZeneca vaccine to provide second doses to individuals who cannot or will not receive a different type of vaccine. Please check the [online vaccine finder](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/finder.html) to confirm they have stock and are able to accept appointments.

## COVID Symptoms & Testing

_Last updated: June 10, 2021_

### Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 may include any of the following:

- Fever/Chills
- Cough
- Sore throat/hoarse voice
- Difficulty breathing
- Loss of taste or smell
- Vomiting, diarrhea for more than 24 hours
- Runny nose
- Muscle aches
- Fatigue
- Pink eye (conjunctivitis)
- Headache
- Skin rash of unknown cause
- Poor feeding in an infant
- Nausea or loss of appetite

While many people will develop only mild symptoms, some groups appear to be more vulnerable to COVID-19. Those at higher risk typically develop more serious, even fatal, symptoms such as pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and kidney failure.

### High risk groups for COVID-19

High risk groups for COVID-19 include people:

- 60 years of age and older
- Living with chronic health conditions (e.g. diabetes, heart, renal or chronic lung conditions)
- With weakened immune systems (e.g. cancer)

**Symptoms of COVID-19 or other coronaviruses may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the virus.**

### When should I get Tested?
Testing should be done **as soon as possible once symptoms appear**. You should still be tested even if your symptoms are very mild or if they start to improve after 24 hours. It is important to get tested as soon as symptoms appear, as tracing and isolating contacts in a timely manner is important to limiting the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

If you have **one symptom listed in column A**, OR **two or more symptoms listed in column B**, you should immediately isolate yourself and [use the online screening tool](https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/screening-tool/) or call **Health Links - Info Santé** (204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257) for further instructions, including where to go for testing and/or assessment.

Symptoms **A** | Symptoms **B**
--- | ---
Fever/Chills | Runny nose
Cough | Muscle aches
Sore throat/hoarse voice | Fatigue
Shortness of breath/difficulty breathing | Pink eye (conjunctivitis)
Loss of taste or smell | Headache
Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 24 hours | Skin rash of unknown cause
&nbsp; | Poor feeding if an infant
&nbsp; | Nausea or loss of appetite

<a href="https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/test-results/" class="button">COVID Test Results</a>

If you choose to not get tested, you will need to isolate for at least 10 days, and until you no longer have fever for 24 hours and your other symptoms have resolved. If you have travelled or been exposed to a case, you should continue to self-isolate (quarantine) for the remainder of the 14-day period.

↑ <a href="#top" class="backtotop">Back to the top of the page</a>

<a name="self-isolation"></a>
## Self Isolation & Isolation

_Last updated: June 25, 2021_

### What is the difference between Self-Isolation (quarantine) and Isolation?

**Self-isolation**, or quarantine, is the **14-day period** in which individuals who **may have been exposed to COVID-19**, through close contact or travel, but do not yet know if they are sick, are asked to stay away from others to limit further spread. It may take up to 14 days to become infected. Even if you do not have symptoms now, it is possible to transmit COVID-19 before you start showing symptoms or without ever developing symptoms.

If you become symptomatic during your self-isolation (quarantine), you will need to get tested and must continue self-isolating. If you do not have any symptoms after your 14-day self-isolation (quarantine) period and you have tested negative, you can stop self-isolating.

**Isolation** is the **10-day period** in which individuals who are sick or have **tested positive for COVID-19** are required to stay away from others who are not sick because they could spread COVID-19. Most people are infectious for 10 days after their symptoms begin. If you’re still symptomatic at day 10, you will need to continue isolating.

### When to Self-Isolate (close contact or traveling)

It is critical to **SELF-ISOLATE** (14 days since last exposure) yourself whenever:

- You have recently returned to Manitoba from domestic or international travel.
    - **Fully vaccinated** people (14 days after receiving 2nd dose of COVID vaccine) no longer need to self-isolate after domestic travel when <u>returning</u> to Manitoba (you will still need to follow other rules set out for each province).
- You have been identified as a close contact to a confirmed COVID-19 case.
    - **Fully vaccinated** people (14 days after receiving 2nd dose of COVID vaccine) no longer need to self-isolate if identified as a close contact to a confirmed COVID-19 case AND you do not have a medical condition that could compromise effectiveness.
- You live with a household member who is self-isolating (quarantining) due to exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case or recent return from domestic or international travel.
- You share a household with a COVID-19 case who is currently isolating at home.

Self-isolation is for 14 days, total. This means your self-isolation period ends on the 15th day after you may have been exposed to COVID-19 or returned for Manitoba. For example, if your _Day One_ was June 2, your self-isolation ends on June 16. If you have no symptoms, this means you can stop self-isolating on June 17.

### When to Isolate (tested positive or waiting results or have symptoms)

It is critical to **ISOLATE** (10 days since last exposure) yourself whenever:

- You have tested positive for COVID-19.
- You have been tested and are waiting for your test results.
- You have COVID-19 symptoms, regardless of whether you have been exposed through travel or contact with a case.

#### Implications for Household Members
If you have household members, they will be considered close contacts and are required to self-isolate (quarantine). The duration of their self-isolation (quarantine) period will depend on your ability to isolate away from them.

If you are able to isolate away from your household members (e.g. separate living space and washroom and no shared spaces, including the kitchen) and have no close contact with them, they will be required to self-isolate (quarantine) for 14 days from their last contact with you. Testing to ensure there hasn’t been household transmission is required to end their isolation at 14 days.

If you are unable to isolate away from your household members (e.g. shared spaces), they will need to self-isolate (quarantine) for your isolation period (usually 10 days), plus 14 days after you end your isolation. This means that household members will need to stay at home and not go out to work, school or other places for at least 24 days.

### How to Isolate/Self-Isolate:

- **Stay at home.**
- **Do not have any visitors to your home.**
- Confine activities to your home and outdoor property.
- Do not leave home to go to work, school or other public places.
- Do not attend faith-based services.
- Arrange to have groceries and supplies dropped off at your door. Do not go to curbside pickup from stores and restaurants.
- Cancel or notify service providers who regularly come into your home that you or a household member is sick. Consult with home care workers, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers, and other service providers that come to your home about the best action for care.

### Requirements & Fines

Public health orders require Manitobans to self-isolate for 14 days if:

- they have tested positive for COVID-19; or
- they have been exposed to COVID-19 by a close contact.

Individuals will be notified by a public health official if self-isolation is required. Once notified, the person must go to their residence or an approved self-isolation location and remain there for 14 days, or until they are directed otherwise by a public health official.

Failure to self-isolate in accordance with public health advice is a violation of the order and is [enforceable under the Public Health Act](https://www.gov.mb.ca/asset_library/en/proactive/20212022/orders-soe-selfisolation-contact-tracing-06102021.pdf). Individuals could be subject to fines for non-compliance.

<a name="variants"></a>
## Variants of Concern

_Last updated: July 8, 2021_

All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, some changes may affect the virus’s properties, such as how easily it spreads, the associated disease severity, or the performance of vaccines, therapeutic medicines, diagnostic tools, or other public health and social measures.

For more information about Variants of Concern, visit the [WHO website](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).

In Manitoba, we currently track the following Variants of Concern:

WHO label | Lineage | Origin | Earliest Sample Date | Designation Date
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Alpha** | B.1.1.7 | United Kingdom | September, 2020 | December 18, 2020
**Beta** | B.1.351<br />B.1.351.2<br />B.1.351.3 | South Africa | May, 2020 | December 18, 2020
**Gamma** | P.1<br />P.1.1<br />P.1.2 | Brazil | November, 2020 | January 11, 2021
**Delta** | B.1.617.2<br />B.1.617.2.1<br />B.1.617.2.2 | India | October, 2020 | May 11, 2021

There are also several other **variants of <u>interest</u>** that are being monitored right now, and may eventually become **variants of <u>concern</u>**.

Currently, the **Alpha** (B.1.1.7 / UK) variant is the dominant strain, suspected to account for roughly 60% of all new COVID cases in Manitoba (_as of July 8, 2021_). Manitoba does not currently have the capacity to sequence the exact strain of every last COVID case, so in many cases, they are labeled as "unspecified", but assumed to be the **Alpha** (B.1.1.7 / UK) variant. Based on the evidence so far, researchers believe the **Alpha** variant is much more contagious and more deadlier than other variants, resulting in more younger people ending up in the hospital and an increase in ICU hospitalizations.

The **Delta** (B.1.617.2 / India) variant has been discovered in Manitoba in June, and is reported to be much more contagious than the **Alpha** variant, and more likely to evade current vaccines, which is why the second dose of vaccine is very important. This variant is expected to eventually become the new dominant strain in time.

There are reports about a **Lambda** (C.37 / Peru) variant emerging, but it's important to note that the WHO currrently considers this a **variants of <u>interest</u>** (not "**concern**"). Investigations are ongoing to determine if it poses a significant threat.

### Will the Vaccine protect against Variants?

All approved vaccines in Canada are proven to be effective against the variants of concern, but studies suggest that 1 dose may not offer robust enough protection against the new **Delta** variant. This is why it's very important to receive your second dose of vaccine as soon as possible.

## Fines

_Last updated: September 10, 2021_

Below is a summary of Fine amounts for violating public health orders in Manitoba:


- **$298** for not wearing a mask in indoor public places. _Increases to $486 for repeat offenders._
- **$1,296** to individuals for failing to comply with public health orders such as illegal gatherings, failing to isolate, etc. _Increases to $2,542 for repeat offenders._
- **$5,000** to corporations for failing to comply with public health orders.

Unpaid fines for tickets for Public Health Act offences proceed through the provincial offences court. If the ticket is not responded to during the response period indicated on the ticket, the individual would be default convicted and a $100 default conviction penalty would be applied. In such cases, the individual would also be prohibited from renewing a driver’s license or vehicle registration until the amount is paid. Unpaid amounts are also sent to a collections agency for further collection action.

## Daily Dashboards

_Last updated: September 14, 2021_

Every day, we comb through all official COVID data and present it as a single unified dashboard, offering an easy-to-read and intuitive experience for understanding the current situation in Manitoba. All of the data comes from official sources, while some data comes from our own calculations. Here's an overview of every part of the daily dashboards and where/how we make calculations.

### Data Sources

- [Official Manitoba Case Data](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/updates/cases.html)
- [Official Manitoba Vaccine Data](https://www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/vaccine/reports.html)
- [Official Manitoba News Bulletins](https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html)
- [Provincial Case Reporting (ici.radio-canada.ca)](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2020/09/covid-19-pandemie-cas-deces-propagation-vague-maladie-coronavirus/index-en.html)
- [Provincial Vaccination Rate Reporting (ctvnews.ca)](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-vaccination-tracker-how-many-people-in-canada-have-received-shots-1.5247509)

### Descriptions & Calculations

#### (1) Today
The total listed here is based on what the province reported today, usually from yesterday's tests. On Mondays (or other days after a holiday and/or long weekend), when more than 1 day is presented, we'll include an average. For example, on Mondays, we'll include an average of all 3 days (Saturday, Sunday and Monday). If there were 120 cases total, we will display the daily average as 40. The 7-day average in smaller text below is based on the last 7 days of new case totals.

#### (2) Active
The total listed here is based on the **last 10 days of new cases**. This is because the Manitoba government's official active case total is usually very backlogged, as they appear to not be able to keep up with following up with people and confirming they have recovered. The vast majority of people with COVID-19 recover and are no longer infectious after 10 days, so we instead use an estimated total that is based on that. Whether or not the real number is a touch higher or lower, this offers the most consistent gauge on current active cases.

#### (3) Hosp
The total listed here is the total number of hospitalized patients that are in the hospital with and/or due to COVID. The province breaks down cases as "active" (infectious) and "non-active" (past the infectious period), but we don't see why it's necessary to distinguish this difference, so we don't include it. This total includes the total number of people in the ICU as well.

#### (4) ICU
The total listed here is the total number of hospitalized patients requiring intensive care that are in the hospital with and/or due to COVID. The province breaks down cases as "active" (infectious) and "non-active" (past the infectious period), but we don't see why it's necessary to distinguish this difference, so we don't include it.

#### (5) Deaths
The large number here is the number of new deaths reported today. The province delays this data in order to verify and prevent incorrect reporting, so please note that most deaths reported today likely happened a week or more ago. The smaller total is the total number of deaths due to COVID since the beginning of the pandemic.

#### (6) Vaccine Uptake
As of September 14, 2021, we're basing all vaccination calculations on the entire population (age 0+). Most times you may see these numbers reported elsewhere as age 12+ or age 18+, but just because children under the age of 12 are not eligible, it does not mean they cannot contract and pass the virus around, etc, so we believe it paints the most accurate picture of the current number of people vaccinated.

- **Fully vaxxed** refers to the total number of Manitobans that have received at least 2 vaccinations.
- **1+ doses** refers to the total number of Manitobans that have received at least 1 vaccination.
- **Without** refers to the total number of Manitobans that have not yet received any vaccination.
- **Partial vax** refers to the total number of Manitobans that have received only 1 dose of the vaccine (different than _at least 1 dose_).
- **Ineligible** refers to the total number of Manitobans not currently eligible to receive any COVID vaccine (under age 12).

All of our calculations such as totals, age group and health region are based upon population totals from the [Manitoba Population Report - June 1, 2020](https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/population/) (latest available). The government likely has access to more current population data, so totals might differ ever so slightly.

#### (7) Protection
The Vaccine Protection area provides a breakdown of cases and hospitalizations in order to show vaccine effectiveness. Please note that the **Active Cases** total is based on the provinces potentially backlogged case count. The hospitalizations and ICU numbers are based only on "active" (infectious) patients.

#### (8) Provincial Stats
This section displays active cases, hospitalization and vaccine uptake data about the 6 provinces (BC, AB, SK, MB, ON, QC). All of the data is from **yesterday**, as more Western provinces take longer to report their totals due to time zone differences. For the most accurate comparison, active cases are based on the last 10 days of new case reporting. Vaccine uptake numbers are based on the total number of people with at least 2 doses of vaccine.

#### (9) Variants of Concern
The breakdown here is unfortumately likely not the most accurate representation of active Variants of Concern. The province takes a long time to sequence and identify variants, so some cases may not be flagged as variants until a few days later. Then, many that are flagged as variants are not yet identified for another week or longer. It's likely safe to assume that the breakdown of the **Unknown** variants is similar to the breakdown of the indentified cases. For example, if there were 8 Delta cases, 2 Alpha cases, and 10 Unknown cases, you can roughly assume that perhaps there's actually 16 Delta cases and 4 Alpha cases (though it could also be that one variant is taking over, so the breakdown may be weighted more heavily to the newer variant).

## About Us

_Last updated: June 29, 2021_

The _Manitoba COVID-19 Updates_ account/site is completely volunteer run. We receive no funding, we make no money. We're fueled by your positive feedback and when you share our social media accounts with others. It is **not** affiliated with the Manitoba government in any way. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I found myself wanting to help serve Manitoba in a meaningful way. Not going to give any excuses, but that didn't quite happen during the first year. Then in January, 2021 (better late than never!), I saw an opportunity. I am a designer and project manager by trade, and throughout the second wave I became very frustrated with how difficult it was to access, read, and understand the updates and news about COVID in Manitoba. On January 5, 2021, we published our first daily update, and over the past several months have grown significantly in social media followers (THANK YOU!).

### Private/Direct Messages

I do my best to answer as many people as possible, but I am one person with a regular full time job and family and don't have the time and all the answers to get to everyone. I apologize if I haven't replied to your private messages in the past (or future). As the following grows bigger and bigger, it's even harder to keep up. I built this website resource in hopes that it will help answer many questions people ask me privately so they can get answers faster.

<a name="faq"></a>
## Frequently Asked Questions

Here's the beginning of a list of questions that are frequently asked...

### Why don't you emphasize the Test Positivity Rate?

While helpful to use as a partial indicator, an over-emphasis on the 5-day test positivity rate can easily skew things when looked at on its own. For example, throughout the summer of 2020, lots of asymptomatic testing was done, which waters down the percentage (no problem here). During the second wave, asymptomatic testing was mostly canceled, and with huge delays at testing sites, people with minor symptoms likely didn't bother going to get tested, meaning the TPR would skyrocket as it did. Even once the dust settled getting closer to Christmas, the TPR remained very high. However, the number of tests remained very low. Again, nothing wrong here per se. The trouble is that you can't have a reliable measurement when you are changing the parameters all the time, and you also can't rely on something that has massive external factors like people's feelings and opinions. For example, if people are panicked (like in the first wave), you're much more likely to have a higher rate of people going for tests. As people become desensitized and adjusted to the pandemic, you might find people are a bit more relaxed about getting tested. And this does not even factor in regions where there's a higher percentage of people that do not believe COVID is real/a concern. In areas like this, many people with moderate symptoms may be unlikely to get tested. The only data that can't be skewed is hospitalization and deaths, or something like wastewater testing.

## Future

_Last updated: June 17, 2021_

In these challenging times, it's no surprise that I receive tons of anxious and curious questions about the current situation and what the future holds. This will be a growing section where I will attempt to provide answers to some hard questions.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE ARE PERSONAL OPINIONS BASED ON EXISTING EVIDENCE/INFORMATION AND NONE ARE GUARANTEED**

### When will children under the age of 12 be able to get vaccinated?

On May 5, 2021, Pfizer was the first to be approved in children ages 12-17, and currently leads the way in this area. Pfizer is currently testing on children age 6 months - 11 years, which has been divided into three age groups: ages 5 to 11, 2 to 5, and 6 months to 2 years. Larger trials have already begun with the age 5 to 11 group, and it's expected to be complete in September. The shots will continue to be given in a two-dose regimen. People age 12+ currently receive 2 doses of 30 micrograms each. Age 5-11 will be given 10 micrograms doses, and 6 months - 4 years will receive 3 micrograms doses.

**Prediction:** Canada will probably approve Pfizer for age 5-11 in the fall, as early as mid September, as late as October. We already have adequate vaccine supply now with the recent large Moderna shipments and ongoing Pfizer supply. Everyone who wants a vaccine will very likely have it before the end of July. People will continue to get vaccines throughout summer, but there will no longer be any pressure for booking restrictions, etc. Between July and September, Canada/Manitoba will likely be able to stockpile Pfizer vaccines to prepare for a rollout in schools in the fall. Children under 5 may likely be approved in late 2020 or early 2021.

>In addition, the pediatric study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine in children 6 months to 11 years of age is ongoing. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to have definitive readouts and, subject to the data generated, submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (e.g., in the U.S.) or a variation to Conditional Marketing Authorizations (e.g., in the EU) for two cohorts, including children 2-5 years of age and 5-11 years of age, in September. The readout and submission for the cohort of children 6 months to 2 years of age are expected in the fourth quarter.

>If safety and immunogenicity is confirmed, and pending authorization or approval from regulators, we hope to submit the vaccine for potential Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sometime in the September-October timeframe for children 5 to 11, and soon after for 6 months to 5.
